Liquid Vote
===========

Electronic vote collecting software. Each voter has an account and they may vote directly on a bill or they may delegate a representative. For more information [try this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_Vhldz-8).

To ensure one account per voter and no more:

1. The voter creates an accont online
2. The voter enters their election commission registered address
3. That name and address are checked against the voter registration roles
4. If a match is found a secret code is sent to the voter via post
5. The voter enters the code and verifies their identity
